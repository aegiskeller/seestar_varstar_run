# seestar_varstar_run

The following is a branch off the seestar_run.py script

I am aiming for a version that will be more ameanable to variable star observing.

To this end, seestar_varstar.py will:

1. allow for an observing manifest
2. targets on the manifest can be cycled through or observed in order
3. The individual exposure times can be adjusted from the default 10 seconds. The Seestar S50 will saturate at ~8.5 mag in 10 seconds
